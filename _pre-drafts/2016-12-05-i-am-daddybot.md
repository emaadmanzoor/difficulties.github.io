Finding out that I'd been selected for a ten month involuntary mobilization to Qatar was probably the most difficult moment of my life. It was a hell of a lot harder than the mobilization itself. All the uncertainty and fear presented itself in the six-month pre-departure phase and the first few months I was gone.

The transition from terror to sanity was aided by a gamble I made less than a month before I left: I bought a Double Robotics telepresence robot, and it made all the difference.

## Concept

This probably won't surprise you very much, but ordering a telepresence robot for my deployment did not immediately occur to me.

The idea first came up when Bob, Mark, and I were sitting around the office thinking about ways to prank our biggest client. Like most brainstorming sessions, it started out ridiculous, and got even further unhinged from reality. By the time I suggested that we rent three telepresence robots and have them delivered to the office for a day, we were already laughing uncontrollably. Then reality started to work its way back into the conversation:

Bob: "Rent them, heck they're not even that expensive. We might as well just buy one."

Me: "How much are they?"

Bob: "About $2500."

Me: "..."

Buying a $2500 telepresence robot to play a practical joke was stupid and insane. But if I bought it to keep in touch with my family from Qatar...

## Prep

As soon as the idea hit me, I knew it had to be done. First off, the cost was unreasonable unless you were in my specific situation. I was going to a non-combat role in a place I knew had good reliable internet access. I would still be close enough to combat to qualify for a tax-exemption, which meant I'd literally save enough in taxes to pay for the thing in the first month I was there. My son would be turning five while I was gone, and he was a huge Transformers fan. The idea that Daddy would be a robot for most of a year wouldn't be a stretch for him. He was still at that age where there wasn't a sharp line between the world of superheroes and "reality".

There was only one catch: my wife. I knew that she was too practical to think this was an executable idea. It certainly sounded insane and profligate. I was convinced it would be awesome, but a skeptical reaction could torpedo the idea before it even had a chance to prove itself.

There was only one option: I had to do it all in secret. The robot would prove itself in the first few days of its existence, but it had to get the opportunity first. I would arrive in Qatar on December 20. The only reasonable approach would be to unveil it at our Christmas Party. There would be tons of people there to support my wife, and the novelty factor alone might just be the edge I needed to get over the weirdness.
