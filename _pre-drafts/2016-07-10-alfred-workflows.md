If you haven't tried it yet, Alfred is really powerful. Like Formula 1 race car powerful. And I'm going to use that Formula 1 race car to drive to the mailbox to check my mail.

That's right. I have no shame. I'm going to show you how to make a simple Alfred custom search that will let you find things on Flickr Commons without the hassle of clicking a bookmark in your browser. Hopefully you can then use your newfound knowledge to do something far more awesome.

Flickr Commons is great. It's not just that all the photos there are free to use any way you like, it's that so many of them are weirdly interesting. The one problem is that if you're doing search after search you're going to want to use that neat little box at the top of the page. Unfortunately that will take you to a full Flickr search, and that's not what we want.

I'm going to short-circuit my brain's tendency to do the wrong thing by training it to do something completely different. First you'll need a copy of Alfred 3 and the Alfred 3 Powerpack. Please don't judge the utility of the Powerpack by my simple Workflow today, it does so much more.
