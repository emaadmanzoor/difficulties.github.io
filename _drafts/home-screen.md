When you reach for a device, which one is it? If you're like me, it's almost
always a smartphone. Unless I'm sleeping or driving, mine is contantly within reach, either in my pocket or on the table in front of me. The smartphone's unrelenting utility, driven by its endless mutability, makes it an indispensable companion.

Whether this is a plus or a minus depends on your perspective. For the first time in the history of humanity, you never have to be out of communication with the ones you love. By the same token, you can never truly be beyond the reach of anyone in the world as long as a smartphone is with you. It's the ultimate double-edged sword, the [soft weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soft_Weapon) made real.[^fn-galaxy]

While I think about this concept a lot, it came back to me when I decided to delete Twitter (well, Tweetbot really) from my phone for something like the tenth time just the other day. It's not that I don't like it. The fact that I like Twitter is actually the whole problem.

[^fn-galaxy]: Quite literally if you were unfortunate enough to own a Samsung Galaxy Note 7.
