Today I'm thrilled to announce the first episode of [Seasons of Obsession](http://seasons.fm), a new podcast with my friend and co-host [Potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire).

{% include image.html file="seasons-1024.jpg" class="right small" title="Seasons of Obsession" %}

As those who follow his [outstanding blog](http://with.thegra.in) already know, Potatowire reads deeply and broadly. His considered and informed perspective is refreshing and thought-provoking. I look forward to helping him find a louder voice and a wider audience.

Seasons will cover new ground for us. Rather than focus on any single topic, we're taking an audio journey through our individual obsessions of the week. You're just as likely to hear a discussion on literature or philosophy as technology or design. What we discuss will be influenced by what we read, hear, see, and think when we record. Like me, you'll get a great preview by reading Potatowire's blog that week. 

We hope to escape the increasingly frantic news cycle and tap into something deeper and longer lasting. To be fair and frank, we can't be more specific than that because we don't quite know where we're headed and that's OK with us. Hopefully you'll come along for the ride.

### Degrees of Difficulty

We're also happy to announce a new home for our assorted audio projects: [Difficult Podcasts](http://difficultpodcasts.fm). 

In addition to Seasons, the DP site has links to our retired shows: Technical Difficulties, Dawn Patrol, and high90cast. Before too long I expect them to be joined by new quirky creations of unknown longevity. We have some ideas, but talking about ideas before they're fully cooked is a mistake we'd like to avoid repeating.

For the first time, we're also asking for your [help](http://difficultpodcasts.fm/support). Maybe not right away, but whenever you feel ready. When that happens, we've got a spot for you in our Slack channel and maybe a bit more if we can build some momentum.

### A Personal Note

First off, I'd like to thank the folks who have made this possible. In addition to my friends and tireless partners Potatowire, [Bob VanderClay](http://twitter.com/takitapart), and [Mark VanderClay](http://twitter.com/djtaco), I would never have started podcasting without the trust, support, and friendship of [Gabe Weatherhead](http://macdrifter.com). His show with [Jeff Hunsberger](http://technologynotes.net/), [Nerds on Draft](http://www.nerdsondraft.com/), is still the one I look forward to the most each week. 

Finally, I'd like to thank *you*. 

Two years ago this week I found out I was getting involuntarily mobilized to the Middle East. The preparation, execution, and return from that deployment, as well as the troubling world events which have occurred over roughly the same period, have been unexpectedly difficult for me, personally, professionally, and creatively. 

I know I'm not alone in this, nor am I the worst affected. Still, the idea that there might still be those out there who find the things I make interesting, informative, and useful, has been enough to keep me going&mdash;even when I wasn't producing much in the way of anything&mdash;even if I'm still not producing much in the way of anything.

Thank you for reading, listening, and hanging on. There's more on the way.
