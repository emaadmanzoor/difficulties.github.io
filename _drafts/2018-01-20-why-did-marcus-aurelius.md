[Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) was a stoic philosopher and the last of Rome's "Five Good Emperors". 

> This is a slightly complicated story.  However, I find it helps to begin just by stating a few important historical facts, which I believe are partly obscured by the portrayal of events in _Gladiator_, although even people who have never seen that movie are often mistaken on these points.

Marcus's [journal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/048629823X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_Yp1yAb06X332M) is on my Stoic short-list alongside Seneca's [_Letters_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140442103/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_ps1yAbFE6A4GW) and the [_Enchiridion_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486433595/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_5t1yAb1GMHFF1).
