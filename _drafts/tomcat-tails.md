Way back in 2004 I was dual-hatted as an instructor at the LSO School and VF-101, the Tomcat training squadron. Sadly for everyone in the Tomcat community, the aircraft was being retired. For decades, we'd have a yearly community ball called Fighter Fling. One of the highlights of Fighter Fling (and every community ball) was the annual video assembled from clips submitted by all the squadrons. I had the honor of co-producing the last two years' worth of Fling videos. 

Each video was four or five songs long. The final year as part of one video sequence I drew up a Tomcat tail honoring each squadron that had ever flown the jet, interleaving it with video of the squadron in question. 

Since these were created for pre-HD video and I was in a time crunch, the first time I made the tails they were at a very low (720x480) resolution. This was before I'd learned how to use Illustrator, so I drew them in Photoshop, practically ensuring they weren't resolution independent. 

One day, noted aviation photographer Erik Hildebrandt asked to include some of the tails in his new book celebrating the Tomcat's farewell. In their current state, my tails were nowhere near print resolution, so (more to please myself than anyone else) I upscaled all of them so they'd look good on a 10" x 8" page at 300dpi. This took a while. Luckily I had a lot of screen space on my brand new 17" Aluminum PowerBook G4 -- my first Mac laptop.

After going to all the trouble to rework the tails, I looked for something else to do with them. They found their way onto a Tomcat Sunset t-shirt at one point. Right around that time I moved into a house with two big empty walls in the entryway, so I threw up some gallery lighting, ordered a bunch of nice frames from Amazon, had some prints made from my local Kinko's, and (with the help of Bob and Mark) started hanging them on the wall. The final result filled the empty space on my wall (if not in my heart) and they even looked kind of nice up there.

In 2010 I got married, moved out of that house and put the frames into storage (all 36 of them). We haven't had a great spot to display them since then (they take up a *lot* of space) so they're still sitting in boxes. I stole six of the frames to make a family calendar this year, which I'll describe in another post as soon as I can figure out how to do it without sharing my family's next four month agenda.

Even so, it seemed a shame for all that artwork to go to waste. So I did what anyone does with a bunch of random art in 2017: I made a sticker pack.

It's not that I think there's a huge market for Tomcat tail stickers out there. It's really more that it's stunningly easy to make a sticker pack, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I priced the pack at $2 because that seemed like the right thing to do, and because I don't particularly care if a lot of people buy it.

The most fun part (to me anyway) is that I put a blank tail in there so you can combine it with other stickers and make your own silly squadron designs. Go wild. Animated sticker markings can be pleasantly (and unpleasantly) surreal.

Nobody who's reading this *needs* a Tomcat tail sticker pack. After all, they're just iMessage stickers. But if you've ever liked anything I've made and wanted to give back a bit, I'd appreciate it if you bought the pack and sent a few random tails to your friends. Someone out there (probably in Japan) might find a Tomcat Tails sticker pack ridiculously useful or joy-inducing. Knowing that would make me happy too.

I miss the Tomcat. Flying it was like driving a classic Mustang -- no A/C, no power steering, no power windows, and just an AM radio, but it had a hell of a lot of acceleration and was a whole lot of fun to drive. Not the kind of car you'd necessarily want to take to the grocery store every day, but if you did, you'd sure look cool doing it. The Super Hornet is more like a brand-new SUV. Comfy, great cruise control, lots of room to carry stuff, but neither fast nor glamorous.

Everything changes, even airplanes. But stickers are totally forever.
