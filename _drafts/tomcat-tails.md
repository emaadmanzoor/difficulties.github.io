<span class="smallcaps">Way back in 2004,</span> I was dual-hatted as an instructor at the [LSO School][1] and [VF-101][2], the Tomcat training squadron. I'd drawn up a bunch of Tomcat tail graphics for a squadron video project and one day aviation photographer [Erik Hildebrandt][3] asked if he could include some of them in a [book][4] celebrating the Tomcat's retirement. 

The tails were designed for pre-HD video (and I was in a time crunch) so they were all drawn at a very low (720x480) resolution. Even worse, I hadn't learned how to use Illustrator yet, so instead I used Photoshop, practically ensuring they weren't resolution independent. 

Since the tails were nowhere near print quality, I went ahead and upscaled them all so they'd look good on a 10" x 8" page at 300dpi. This took some time and effort, but fortunately I had power and screen space to spare on my brand new 17" Aluminum PowerBook G4 -- my very first Mac laptop.

After going to all the trouble, I looked for something else to do with them. They found their way onto a t-shirt at one point. Right around that time I moved into a house with two big empty walls in the entryway, so I threw up some gallery lighting, ordered a bunch of nice frames from Amazon, had some prints made at my local Kinko's, and (with the help of Bob and Mark) started hanging them on the wall. The final result filled the empty space on my wall (if not in my heart) and they even looked kind of nice.

In 2010 I got married, moved out of that house and put the frames into storage (all 36 of them). We haven't had a great spot to display them since then (they take up a *lot* of space) so they're still sitting in boxes. I stole six of the frames to make a family calendar this year, which I'll describe in another post as soon as I can figure out how to do it without sharing my family's next four month agenda.

Even so, it seemed a shame for all that artwork to go to waste. So I did what anyone does with a bunch of random art in 2017: I made a [sticker pack](https://appsto.re/us/j8oyhb.i?app=messages). The most fun part (to me anyway) is the blank tail. I thought people might want to combine it with other stickers and make their own silly squadron designs. Animated GIFs are particularly surreal.

It's not that I think there's a huge market for Tomcat tail stickers out there. It's really more that it's stunningly easy to make a sticker pack, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I priced the pack at $2 because that seemed like the right thing to do, and because I don't expect a lot of people buy it. Nobody who's reading this *needs* a Tomcat tail sticker pack. After all, they're just iMessage stickers. 

That being said, if you've ever liked anything I've made and wanted to give back a bit, I'd appreciate it if you [bought the pack](https://appsto.re/us/j8oyhb.i?app=messages) and sent a few random tails to your friends. Someone out there (probably in Japan) might find a Tomcat Tails sticker pack ridiculously useful or joy-inducing. Knowing that would make me happy too.

I miss the Tomcat. Flying it was like driving a classic Mustang -- you might not have A/C, power steering, power windows, or FM radio, but with a hell of a lot of acceleration available, it's still be a whole lot of fun to drive. Maybe it's not the kind of car you'd necessarily want to take to the grocery store every day, but if you did, you'd sure look cool doing it. The Super Hornet is more like a brand-new SUV. Comfy, great cruise control, lots of room to carry stuff, but not exactly fast and not quite as glamorous.


Everything changes, even airplanes. But stickers are totally forever.
