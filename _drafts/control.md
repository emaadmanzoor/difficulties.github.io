Every day offers a chance for a new beginning. I'd like to start this one with some excerpts from the *Enchiridion* of Epictetus. 

*Enchiridion* is Greek for *handbook*. It was compiled by one of Epictetus's students as a short guide to his Stoic teachings, and it starts like this:

> Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing.

What's in your power? I mean really, what do you control? 

We think we control our bodies, I mean why wouldn't we? You decide to go for a walk, and you just walk. You want to get in better shape, so you exercise. You want to be healthy, so you eat right.

But are you really controlling your body and everything that happens to it? Not a chance. You've made some decisions of course. You've initiated some actions. I walked out in my driveway to bring in the garbage a few years ago, then rolled my ankle and snapped a bone in my foot. I decided to ski with my family a couple of months ago, and tore my ACL.

Was I in control of my body then? How about afterward, when I was in pain and unable to walk normally? If you have epilepsy or Parkinson's Disease are you in control of your body? Cancer?

This same principle applies in other areas as well. You have a nice car and you drive it safely. Someone else doesn't and your car is a wreck. Hopefully you're OK. Sometimes you're not.

You're an ethical person who does everything you can to treat those around you with care and respect. One day a jealous co-worker spreads false rumors about you and a big promotion goes to someone else.

There's a theme here. You can choose to believe something, work towards a goal, and decide what you're going to try to chase after or stay away from, but beyond that the results are pretty much up to the universe.

Presuming Epictetus and the other Stoics are correct, how does it make you feel? 

What should we do in response?
