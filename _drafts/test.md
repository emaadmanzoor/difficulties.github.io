What's a phone?

It's a difficult question these days. When I grew up, it was a thing tethered to your wall (or at best wirelessly paired to a base station in your house) that let you talk to people.

Now when people talk about phones they usually mean a pocketable digital multi-tool with a touch interface, camera, and a persistent (if occasionally slow) wireless internet connection.

What do we want out of it?

I've bounced around a lot on this specific question lately, but conceptually things are starting to sort themselves out. It seems like our phones should be the smallest sliver of computing we can possibly stand. 

For someone without other devices, that may mean it's a pretty big device. If you spend eight hours a day working with something through rapidly changing environments (a bus or train, for example) you might want the biggest screen you can safely handle. If you work on a machine at a desk and walk, bike, or drive a car to get there, you might be able to get away with something much smaller.

There's also another factor to consider: what do you *want* to be doing on your phone?

As someone who has used his phone to escape connection with the world around him, this is a question with great promise for me. Today I'm considering going back to a tiny phone because it's uncomfortable for that kind of checking out. The ideal solution might be a cell-enabled watch, but for now that's a dream.
