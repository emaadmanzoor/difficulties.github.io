David Brooks [at the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/opinion/internet-technology-stalin-dictators.html):

> Back in Stalin’s day, social discipline was so drastic. You had to stage a show trial (so expensive!), send somebody to the gulag or organize a purge. Now your tyranny can be small, subtle and omnipresent. It’s like the broken windows theory of despotism. By punishing the small deviations, you prevent the big ones from ever happening.
