Today [Potatowire](http://with.thegra.in) and I released the second episode of our new podcast [Seasons of Obsession](http://seasons.fm).

> Erik and Potatowire celebrate a birthday, then talk about what they read, why they choose what they read, how they try to escape the bubble, reading faster, and keeping an open mind.

I really liked recording *and* editing this one, and hopefully you will too. It was my first experience using [Podcast Chapters](http://chaptersapp.com) and I was very impressed with how easy the app was to use.

One other quick note: both the show's website and the [Difficult Podcasts](http://difficultpodcasts.fm) master site are generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The sites themselves are still under heavy development, and I recently switched our audio file hosting to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Please let us know [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/difficultpods) if you notice any quirks, and thanks for listening.
