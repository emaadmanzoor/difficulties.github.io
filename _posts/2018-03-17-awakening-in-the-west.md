Another gem from [James Ford](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/):

> Although, just like with Zen, we need to start by saying much of what we probably think Stoicism is, is probably wrong. For most of us being "stoic" is sucking it up, finding that stiff upper lip, and gutting it through, whatever the situation might be. This isn’t a new way of thinking about Stoicism. Someone who did the research found that usage dating from the middle of the sixteenth century. Nonetheless, I suggest such a view of stoicism is missing the great gift to Western spirituality that this ancient Greek and Roman spiritual insight in fact offers. Stoicism is about learning to fall in a world where we’re all falling.
