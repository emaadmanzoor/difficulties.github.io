For some reason I enjoy using my 13&Prime; iPad Pro in portrait mode. I'm not sure if this sickness began when I plopped my first-gen iPad on the original keyboard dock, or if the Pro's resemblance to an anachronistic "sheet-of-paper" style document makes me want to return to simpler times. I'm on record believing that portrait orientation is superior to landscape for writing and editing, and I'm fully aware that it's a minority opinion.

I searched for a stand that could adapt to my strangeness and found the [Anker Multi-Angle Aluminum Stand](https://amzn.com/B00D856NOG). It's simple, light, and folds as flat as you could hope for something that's strong enough to hold an iPad Pro. The stand will fit easily in even the smallest bags, and while you probably wouldn't want to carry it around in your pocket, it's certainly possible.

There's a cylinder which serves as the hinge. Press the button on its left side and the stand will rotate through about 210&deg;, allowing for a near-infinite variety of positions. There are rubber feet to protect the table, and other rubber feet to protect your tablet. There's a removable insert in case your tablet is extra-thick, but the iPad Pro 13&Prime; with Smart Keyboard attached fits without taking it out. 

The stand is sturdy enough to handle the 13&Prime; Pro in landscape and portrait without tipping over. It even held an iPhone SE in a case without looking excessively ridiculous. There's a notch at the bottom which leaves the home button free enough to use Touch ID.

In case you haven't purchased anything from Anker before, their stuff is high quality and low price. My stand came in shiny silver, but you can get it in black as well. If you're looking for a portable stand for your tablet or even a big phone, this one's worth a look.
