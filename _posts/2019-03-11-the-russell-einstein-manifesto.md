At [Arms Control Wonk](https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1206896/the-russell-einstein-manifesto/), Michael Krepon discusses the landmark 1955 manifesto authored by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) and [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) shortly before his death. 

> There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.
