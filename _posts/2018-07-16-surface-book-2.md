On his site [Charged](https://char.gd/blog/), developer [Owen Williams](https://char.gd/about) has a [compelling review](https://char.gd/blog/2018/the-surface-book-2-is-everything-the-macbook-pro-should-be-and-then-some) of the latest 15-inch Surface Book 2:

> I've been hunting for a [great MacBook Pro replacement since early 2017](https://char.gd/blog/2017/why-i-left-mac-for-windows-apple-has-given-up) and while I've been happy with my switch to a desktop machine at home, it's been an interesting journey trying to find something that's on the same all-around hardware and software experience on the laptop side.
> 
> Over the past year I've spent time with the [Razer Blade](https://char.gd/blog/2017/the-razer-blade-a-killer-macbook-pro-replacement), [Dell XPS 15](https://char.gd/blog/2018/ive-finally-found-a-macbook-replacement-that-doesnt-suck) and the [Eve V](https://char.gd/blog/2017/a-startup-made-a-better-laptop-than-anyone-else-could), which are all stellar machines, but I didn't quite feel at home yet. These are fantastic machines that do the job well, but always left something wanting, which I figured I'd need to settle for.
>
> I'm back to say I was wrong, and I've found a machine that not only matches Apple's standard of hardware quality, but goes far beyond it to demonstrate how a laptop of the future should work.
>
> That machine is the 15-inch Surface Book 2 and somehow Microsoft has made the 2-in-1 that Apple should've been building all along, to the same level of quality I'd expect from anyone other than Microsoft. 
>
> I've used the Surface Book 2 as my daily computer for three months now and it's consistently blown me away with how well considered it is across the board, how great the software works and has completely converted me into the touchscreen laptop camp.

Owen's reviews (there are more available at the links above) are thorough and practical. His [posts](https://char.gd/blog/2017/essential-apps-for-switching-from-mac-to-windows) have been [quite helpful](https://char.gd/blog/2017/how-to-set-up-the-perfect-modern-dev-environment-on-windows)  as I transition away from the Mac, and I highly recommend them if you're considering the same.

As for me, the XPS 15 is doing great, and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of my [Surface Go](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/9/17550252/microsofts-surface-go-tablet-10-inch-screen-399) next month. I'll let you know how it works once I've used it for a bit.
